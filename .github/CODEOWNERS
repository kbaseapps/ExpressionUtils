# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# The owners listed will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. 

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
