# ExpressionUtils
---

A [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase SDK](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).
A module to upload, download and export RNASeq Expression data obtained by either StringTie or Cufflinks Apps.




TODO:
- ReadsAlignmentUtils and this kbase module both use a set of utility functions in a python module
called script_utils. This module should be placed in a separate github respository and then imported
into these and other kbase modules that require the utility functions.
